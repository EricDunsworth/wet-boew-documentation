The following are design decision for WET. Those decision are used for providing guidance on how to design content, features and theme. These design decision would be reviewed by the WET-BOEW Roadmap group.

In order to obselete a decision, the evidence would need to be presented explaining why it is not valid anymore, a recommendation explaining how to do it and a method to migrate content that was following the obseleted design decision. You can initiate the conversation by submiting a new issue on Github.
