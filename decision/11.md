## Issue

There is no clear definitions as to what method should be used for resizing text in WCAG guideline 1.4.4. 

## Background

- According to WCAG guideline 1.4.4 - Resize Text, text can be resized up to 200% without losing its content or functionality. 
- There are two methods of resizing text built into web browsers.
	- Regular zoom: resizing every contents of the page. 
	- Text-only zoom: resizing text only leaving other contents such as image unchanged.
	
## Approach

Even though, it is highly recommended that WCAG Guideline 1.4.4 - Resize Text be met using both methods of resizing text, it is sufficient if only one method was used to pass the guideline.
