<p>British nationals made over 2.3 million visits to Turkey in 2018. Most visits are trouble free. Be alert to your surroundings and remain vigilant in crowded places popular with foreign nationals, including during festival periods.</p>

<p>A Pegasus Airlines domestic flight from Izmir crashed on landing at Istanbulâ€™s Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport on 5 February. The airport has been closed. If youâ€™re due to travel to or from Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en airport, you should check with your airline for updates before travelling to your departure airport.</p>

<p>A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Elazig and neighbouring provinces in the east of Turkey on the evening of 24 January, causing damage to local buildings and a number of fatalities.  A number of aftershocks have also been reported.  A disaster response is underway. You should avoid the immediate vicinity, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>

<p>Following the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US strike in Baghdad on 3 January, the incident has led to increased tensions in the region. There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests and the security situation could worsen with little warning. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media and <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/email-signup">this travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>Turkey is conducting a military operation in north-eastern Syria. This has led to heightened tensions in border regions, including cross-border rocket and mortar attacks into Turkey, close to the border. If youâ€™re in provinces bordering Syria, you should remain extremely vigilant and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/safety-and-security#syrian-border">Syrian border</a></p>

<p>Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow the advice of the local authorities. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/natural-disasters">Natural disasters</a></p>

<p>The situation has calmed following an attempted coup in July 2016. A state of emergency imposed after the coup attempt has been lifted, although some restrictions remain in place. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/safety-and-security#political-situation">Political situation</a></p>

<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey. Terrorist groups, including Kurdish groups, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. Further attacks could be indiscriminate. Most attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country, and in Ankara and Istanbul. While there is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities, attacks are most likely to target the Turkish state, civilians and demonstrations. You should be vigilant, follow the advice of local security authorities, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/terrorism">Terrorism</a></p>

<p>Itâ€™s illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey, including expressions of support on social media. Some organisations in the region though not proscribed in the UK, such as the YPG and the GÃ¼len Movement are illegal in Turkey.</p>

<p>British nationals need a visa to travel to Turkey, except for some cruise ship passengers arriving at sea ports for visits of up to 72 hours. If youâ€™re visiting Turkey as a tourist or on business, get an <a rel="external" href="https://www.evisa.gov.tr/">e-Visa</a> online before you travel. Make sure you use the official e-Visa website so you get a genuine visa without paying additional fees. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/entry-requirements#visas">Visas</a></p>

<p>You should carry your passport and a printed copy of your e-visa (if applicable) or residence permit at all times. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the Turkish authorities are stopping members of the public to conduct ID checks. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/local-laws-and-customs">Local laws and customs</a></p>

<p>There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay. You can find more information about the action you can take if you have suffered a personal injury on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/legal-system/personal-injury/personal-injuries/">Citizens Advice website</a>. You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness. If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Turkey.</p>

<p>You can contact the emergency services by calling 155 (police), 112 (ambulance) and 110 (fire).</p>

<p>If youâ€™re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.

      <p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Turkey.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel="external" href="https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/staysafe/">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad">global threat from terrorism</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Most terrorist attacks have taken place in the south-east of the country and in Ankara and Istanbul. While there is a potential that citizens from western countries may be targets or caught up in attacks, particularly in the major cities, attacks are most likely to target the Turkish state, civilians and demonstrations.</p>

<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting public buildings, major events or large public gatherings. Be vigilant around significant religious occasions and public holidays; terrorist groups sometimes call for attacks around these times.</p>

<p>Previous methods of attack have included armed assaults, suicide bombings, car bombings and rocket attacks and improvised explosive devices left in refuse bins, crowded areas and on public transport. Be vigilant, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice.</p>

<p>The Turkish authorities have successfully disrupted attack planning in the recent past and have said that security has been tightened in response to recent attacks.</p>

<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey.  You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s illegal to be a member or supporter of a terrorist organisation in Turkey. Some organisations in the region though not proscribed in the UK, such as the YPG and the GÃ¼len Movement are illegal in Turkey.</p>

<p>A number of terrorist groups are active in Turkey:</p>

<h3 id="daesh">Daesh</h3>
<p>The last major attack attributed to Daesh occurred on 1 January 2017 at the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul; 39 people were killed and 69 injured. 
Extremist groups based in Syria including Daesh and ANF (Al Nusra Front) have the capacity to carry out attacks in neighbouring countries, including Turkey. Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.</p>

<h3 id="pkk">PKK</h3>
<p>Thereâ€™s a domestic terrorist presence in the south east of the country including in Van, Bitlis, Bingol, Elazig, Mus, Batman, Erzincan, Diyarbakir and Agri provinces. In December 2012, talks began between the Turkish Government and the Kurdish aligned PKK (proscribed as a terrorist group in the UK), during which the PKK observed a ceasefire. However, following the Suruc bombing on 20 July 2015, the ceasefire ended when the PKK killed 2 Turkish police officers.</p>

<p>15 August is the anniversary of the first PKK attack against Turkish government installations. Historically, this anniversary date has prompted an escalation of violence by the PKK and other splinter groups.</p>

<p>From the end of July 2015 there was an intensive period of violent incidents in Turkeyâ€™s south-east and other provinces, although the pace of these has now decreased. The vast majority of these incidents have been PKK attacks on Turkish security forces, their premises and vehicles, with many members of the armed forces and police killed and injured. There have also been attacks on infrastructure (eg oil pipelines, dams) and incidents in which civilians have been affected. The government has responded with arrests of PKK suspects in Turkey and sustained military pressure on PKK positions in northern Iraq.</p>

<h3 id="tak-kurdistan-freedom-hawks">TAK (Kurdistan Freedom Hawks)</h3>
<p>TAK have previously carried out attacks in Turkey, and have publically threatened to attack tourist sites. TAK are a proscribed group under UK law.</p>

<h3 id="far-left-groups--dhkp-c-and-thkp-c">Far Left groups â€“ DHKP-C and THKP-C</h3>
<p>The anti-western, far left, proscribed terrorist group, THKP/C-Acilciler (Turkish Peopleâ€™s Liberation Party/Front) and the linked DHKP/C (Revolutionary Peopleâ€™s Liberation Front) remain active, and launched a series of attacks in Istanbul in 2015 targeting the Turkish police and judiciary. The DHKP/C attacks have mainly targeted the Turkish authorities and US diplomatic missions.</p>

<p>Between approximately 30 March and 20 April, there are several dates significant to the DHKP/C, starting with the 30 March anniversary of their founding which may have been linked to previous attacks. 19 December is also recognised as an important date around which the DHKP/C may be active.</p>

<h2 id="global-threat">Global threat</h2>

<p>Thereâ€™s a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.  You should be vigilant at this time.</p>

<h2 id="kidnapping">Kidnapping</h2>

<p>Terrorist groups operating in Syria, including Daesh and AQ-linked groups, routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. Theyâ€™re present in the Syrian border areas and you should be particularly vigilant if you are in these locations. Daesh and other terrorist groups view those engaged in humanitarian aid work or journalism as legitimate targets. If youâ€™re kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to serve as protection or secure your safe release.</p>

<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>

<h3 id="syrian-border">Syrian border</h3>
<p>The FCO advise against all travel to areas within 10km of the border with Syria, except the city of Kilis. The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the remaining areas of Sirnak, Kilis (including Kilis city) and Hatay provinces.</p>

<p>Turkey is conducting a military operation in north-eastern Syria. This has led to heightened tensions in border regions, including cross-border rocket and mortar attacks into Turkey, close to the border. If youâ€™re in provinces bordering Syria, you should remain extremely vigilant and keep up to date with developments via local media and this travel advice.</p>

<p>On 24 August 2016, the Turkish military started operations across the Turkey-Syria border near Karkamis and declared special security zones in villages along the Turkey-Syria border in Gaziantep Province.</p>

<p>Fighting in Syria continues in areas close to the Turkish border and there remains a heightened risk of terrorism in the region.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing conflict in Syria, roads in Hatay province leading towards the border may be subject to closure.</p>

<h3 id="eastern-provinces">Eastern provinces</h3>
<p>The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the provinces of Diyarbakir, Tunceli and Hakkari. Since July 2015 there has been an intensive period of PKK attacks on Turkish security forces, their premises and vehicles. Civilians have been affected. Security operations have taken place in the cities of Diyarbakir, Sirnak and Hakkari, with curfews imposed in these and other towns and cities in the region. If youâ€™re undertaking essential travel to these provinces, you should take extreme care.</p>

<p>A temporary Turkish military restricted zone has been imposed for the Mount Ararat area. No permission is being given for parties to enter the area, nor to climb the mountain. Other temporary military restricted zones have been established in eastern provinces. Donâ€™t attempt to enter these zones. There may be some disruption to travel in these areas.</p>

<p>The PKK have carried out attacks against Turkish security personnel and premises in Van province in August and September 2016. On 17 August 2016 an attack in central Van against a police station killed 3 people and injured 73 others.  On 4 September 2016, a mortar attack was launched against a police checkpoint in the Edremit district of Van Province, but there were no injuries. On 12 September 2016 an attack at a police checkpoint wounded at least 50 people in Van province. There have been subsequent clashes between Turkish security forces and the PKK resulting in a number of deaths and injuries. Take extra care if youâ€™re travelling to this area; keep up to date with local media and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>

<h2 id="political-situation">Political situation</h2>
<p>Sporadic demonstrations take place in cities across Turkey, some of which have, in the past, become violent. In Istanbul previous demonstrations have centered on the area around Taksim Square, on Istiklal Street and in the Besiktas and Kadikoy districts and more recently in Okmeydani. In Ankara, the protests have mainly taken place in the central Kizilay district around the Prime Ministerâ€™s office. In Izmir the focus has been in the town centre, near the water front.</p>

<p>You should avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Police have used tear gas and water cannon extensively to disperse protests. The effects of tear gas can be felt several hundred metres beyond the immediate site of demonstrations. Local transport routes may be disrupted.</p>

<p>The situation in Turkey has calmed following an attempted coup on 15-16 July 2016. The security environment, however, remains potentially volatile. A two-year state of emergency ended in July 2018. However, some additional security measures and restrictions remain in place.</p>

<p>The presidency of the Higher Education Council has issued a revised note indicating that restrictions on leave and travel for university employees donâ€™t apply to foreign nationals. If youâ€™re employed at a university, you should check with your employer directly before taking leave or making any travel plans as the implementation of the restrictions is subject to the discretion of individual institutions.</p>

<h2 id="crime">Crime</h2>
<p>Generally crime levels are low, but street robbery and pick-pocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. If you are going to drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times so they are not spiked. Be wary of strangers approaching you offering food and drink (which may be drugged), to change money or to take you to a restaurant or nightclub.</p>

<p>Passports have been stolen from rented villas, even when they have been kept in the villa safe. This is a particular problem in Didim, Kas, Kalkan and the Fethiye/Hisaronu/Ovacik areas.</p>

<p>In 2018, 32 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey. Most of these cases occurred during the summer holiday period in coastal tourist areas. Many were committed late at night by someone the victim met during the evening. There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. You should be extra vigilant in these situations.</p>

<p>Never accept lifts from strangers. Find a registered yellow taxi and make a note of the registration number before getting in.</p>

<p>Very rarely counterfeit alcohol has been responsible for the death of some tourists. If you have any concerns, seek advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.</p>

<h2 id="road-travel">Road travel</h2>
<p>Take care when travelling by road throughout Turkey, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between the major cities are generally in excellent condition, but can be poor in remote, rural areas. Accidents are common and mainly due to poor or reckless driving.</p>

<p>If you drive in Turkey, you must have either an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit">International Driving Permit</a> or a notarised copy (in Turkish) of your UK driving licence. If you stay in Turkey continuously for more than 6 months, you must convert your UK driving licence into a Turkish licence. Provisional driving licences arenâ€™t recognised. If you intend to bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey you should familiarise yourself with the relevant Turkish customs regulations.</p>

<p>You will need an â€˜Aâ€™ category standard motorcycle licence to hire a motorcycle over 50cc in Turkey. An â€˜A1â€™ category â€˜light motorcycleâ€™ driving licence is only suitable for motorcycles below 50cc. By law you must wear a helmet. Failure to do so could result in a heavy fine.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t drink and drive. The police will breathalyse drunk drivers, fine you on the spot and immediately confiscate your licence for 6 months.</p>

<h2 id="air-travel">Air travel</h2>
<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorist attack against the aviation industry in Turkey. See <a href="/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/terrorism">Terrorism</a></p>

<p>You should co-operate fully with security officials at airports. Restrictions on carrying large electronic devices in the aircraft cabin on flights departing from Turkey to the UK have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-uk-aviation-security">now been lifted</a>. For more information and advice about what items you can take into the cabin on your flight from Turkey to the UK, contact your airline or travel company.</p>

<p>The FCO canâ€™t offer advice on the safety of individual airlines. However, the International Air Transport Association publishes a <a rel="external" href="https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/audit/iosa/Pages/registry.aspx">list of registered airlines</a> that have been audited and found to meet a number of operational safety standards and recommended practices. This list is not exhaustive and the absence of an airline from this list does not necessarily mean that it is unsafe.</p>

<p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation has <a rel="external" href="http://www.icao.int/safety/Pages/USOAP-Results.aspx">carried out an audit</a> of the level of implementation of the critical elements of safety oversight in Turkey.</p>

<p>A list of incidents and accidents in Turkey can be found on the website of the <a rel="external" href="http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=TC">Aviation Safety network</a>.</p>

<h2 id="extreme-sports">Extreme sports</h2>
<p>If you participate in extreme sports (including paragliding, parasailing, white-water rafting, off-road driving and hot air ballooning), satisfy yourself that adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use reputable operators and insist on training before use. Make sure your travel insurance covers you for all the activities you want to undertake. British nationals have been injured and in some cases killed participating in extreme sports.</p>

<h2 id="stray-dogs">Stray dogs</h2>
<p>Most towns and cities have stray dogs. Local authorities take action to control and manage numbers but packs congregate in parks and wastelands and can be aggressive. Take care, remain calm, and avoid approaching stray dogs. If youâ€™re bitten, seek medical advice as rabies and other animal borne diseases are present in Turkey.</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s illegal not to carry some form of photographic ID in Turkey. You should carry your passport and a printed copy of your e-visa (if applicable) or residence permit at all times. In some busy areas, especially Istanbul, the Turkish authorities may stop members of the public to conduct ID checks. Thereâ€™s also a larger than usual number of police checkpoints on main roads across Turkey. You should co-operate with officials conducting checks.</p>

<p>Smoking is prohibited on public transport and in all indoor workplaces and public places. Smoking is restricted in some outdoor areas where cultural, artistic, sports or entertainment activities are held.</p>

<p>Turkey has strict laws against the use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. If you are convicted of any of these offences, you can expect to receive a heavy fine or a prison sentence of 4 to 24 years.</p>

<p>The possession, sale and export of antiquities is against the law and carries a prison sentence of 5 to 12 years as well as a substantial fine. Some historical items found at local markets and in antique shops can be sold within Turkey but are illegal to export. You should confirm the legal requirements before considering a purchase or returning home with an antique/historical item.</p>

<p>Dress modestly if youâ€™re visiting a mosque or a religious shrine to avoid offence.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t take photographs near military or official installations. Ask for permission before photographing people.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is legal in Turkey. However, many parts of Turkey are socially conservative and public displays of affection may lead to unwelcome attention. See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT community before you travel.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an offence to insult the Turkish nation or the national flag, or to deface or tear up currency. If youâ€™re convicted of any of these offences you could face a prison sentence of between 6 months and 3 years. You should be aware that controls carried out by the Turkish authorities, including those that take place at airports, may include the examination of electronic devices.</p>

      <p>The information on this page covers the most common types of travel and reflects the UK governmentâ€™s understanding of the rules currently in place. Unless otherwise stated, this information is for travellers using a full â€˜British Citizenâ€™ passport.</p>

<p>The authorities in the country or territory youâ€™re travelling to are responsible for setting and enforcing the rules for entry. If youâ€™re unclear about any aspect of the entry requirements, or you need further reassurance, youâ€™ll need to contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">embassy, high commission or consulate</a> of the country or territory youâ€™re travelling to.</p>

<p>You should also consider checking with your transport provider or travel company to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.</p>

<h3 id="visas">Visas</h3>

<p>British nationals need a visa to enter Turkey, except for cruise ship passengers with â€˜British Citizenâ€™ passports who arrive at sea ports for tourist visits to the port city or nearby cities, provided that the visit doesnâ€™t exceed 72 hours.</p>

<p>Turkish visit visas are valid for multiple stays up to a maximum of 90 days in a 180 day period.</p>

<p>We recommend that you get an e-Visa online through the <a rel="external" href="https://www.evisa.gov.tr/">official Republic of Turkey e-Visa website</a>. An e-Visa costs $35 (plus $1.05 service fee) and you can pay by credit or debit card. If you use this option, you should apply at least 48 hours before travel and can do so up to 3 months in advance. In case of technical problems at the Turkish port of entry, carry a printed copy of your e-Visa or keep an electronic copy on a smartphone or other device to show at immigration.</p>

<p>Be wary of using unauthorised websites, as these may charge additional fees for supplying information and submitting applications. Some unauthorised websites have also issued fake e-Visas.</p>

<p>If you have any queries regarding e-Visas call the <a rel="external" href="https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/feedback/">Visa Contact Centre</a> (details provided by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs).</p>

<p>Alternatively, until further notice you can get a multiple entry sticker visitor visa, valid for 90 days, on arrival at any port of entry on payment of Â£20 in cash (Scottish and Northern Irish currency is not accepted). However, as the visa on arrival service is likely to be phased out at some point in the near future, we recommend you get an e-Visa.</p>

<p>You can also apply for a visa before you travel from the <a rel="external" href="http://london.emb.mfa.gov.tr/Mission">Turkish Consulate General in London</a>.
If youâ€™re planning to study or work in Turkey, or are unsure about the type of visa you require, you should apply for a visa before travel.</p>

<p>If you hold a different type of British nationality (eg BN(O), British Overseas Citizen, British Protected Person or British Subject), check visa requirements with the <a rel="external" href="http://london.emb.mfa.gov.tr/Mission">Turkish Consulate General</a> before you travel. These types of passport are classed as â€˜UK Special Passportsâ€™ in the Turkish e-Visa system. Youâ€™ll need to apply for a visa from the Turkish Consulate General before you travel.</p>

<p>If you plan to remain in Turkey for a period of more than 90 days, you should either apply for a longer stay visa before you travel, or get a residence permit from the local authorities in Turkey before your 90 day stay has elapsed. If you intend to work in Turkey, ensure you have the correct permits. More information is available from the Turkish Ministry of the Interior. If you donâ€™t abide by the terms of your visa or permit, you may be fined, deported and banned from re-entering the country.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re entering Turkey via a land border crossing, make sure your passport has a dated entry stamp before you leave the border crossing area.</p>

<h3 id="passport-validity">Passport validity</h3>
<p>The Turkish government advise that your passport should be valid for at least 6 months from the date you enter Turkey and that there is a full blank page for the entry and exit stamps. You can find more detail about the requirements for entry into Turkey on the website of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/visa-information-for-foreigners.en.mfa">Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="travelling-with-children">Travelling with children</h3>

      <p>Many parts of Turkey are subject to earthquakes and tremors.</p>

<p>A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Elazig and neighbouring provinces in the east of Turkey on the evening of 24 January, causing damage to local buildings and a number of fatalities.  A number of aftershocks have also been reported.  A disaster response is underway. You should avoid the immediate vicinity, and follow the advice of local authorities. You should familiarise yourself with safety procedures in the event of an earthquake and follow any advice given by the local authorities.</p>

<p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has information about what to do <a rel="external" href="http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes">before, during and after an earthquake.</a></p>

<h3 id="foreign-travel-checklist">Foreign travel checklist</h3>

<p>Read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist">foreign travel checklist</a> to help you plan for your trip abroad and stay safe while youâ€™re there.</p>

<h3 id="travel-safety">Travel safety</h3>

<p>The FCO travel advice helps you make your own decisions about foreign travel. Your safety is our main concern, but we canâ€™t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If youâ€™re concerned about whether or not itâ€™s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory youâ€™re travelling to, together with information from other sources youâ€™ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether itâ€™s safe for you to travel.</p>

<p>When we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, weâ€™ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-the-foreign-commonwealth-office-puts-together-travel-advice">Read more about how the FCO assesses and categorises risk in foreign travel advice</a>.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas">crisis overseas page</a> suggests additional things you can do before and during foreign travel to help you stay safe.</p>

<h3 id="refunds-and-cancellations">Refunds and cancellations</h3>

<p>If you wish to cancel or change a holiday that youâ€™ve booked, you should contact your travel company. The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or canâ€™t offer a refund to their customers.</p>

<p>For more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit <a rel="external" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/">the Citizenâ€™s Advice Bureau website</a>. For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the <a rel="external" href="https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/">website of the Civil Aviation Authority</a>. For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if youâ€™re not happy with their response, you can complain to the <a rel="external" href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>

<h3 id="registering-your-travel-details-with-us">Registering your travel details with us</h3>

<p>Weâ€™re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist">foreign travel checklist</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas">crisis overseas page</a> suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.</p>

<h3 id="previous-versions-of-fco-travel-advice">Previous versions of FCO travel advice</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for a previous version of the FCO travel advice, visit the <a rel="external" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">National Archives website</a>. If you canâ€™t find the page youâ€™re looking for there, send the Travel Advice team <a rel="external" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Turkey&amp;post=Turkey%20travel%20advice%20team">a request</a>.</p>

<h3 id="further-help">Further help</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re a British national and you have a question about travelling abroad that isnâ€™t covered in our foreign travel advice or elsewhere on GOV.UK, you can  <a rel="external" href="https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/?country=Turkey&amp;post=Turkey%20travel%20advice%20team">submit an enquiry</a>.
